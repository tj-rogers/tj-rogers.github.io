Calculate live shipping rates and tax rates based on actual Printful shipping costs

== Description ==

Display actual live shipping rates from carriers like FedEx on your WooCommerce checkout page. This plugin will return a list of available shipping rates specific to the shipping address your customer provides when checking out. These rates are identical to the list you get when you submit an order manually via Printful dashboard.

This plugin will also automatically calculate taxes where it is required for Printful so that your originally intended profit margin stays intact.
